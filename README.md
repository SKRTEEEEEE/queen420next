# Process

## 1.01 DASHBOARD

### .01 Dashboard UI&Link

Created the basic structure of the README.md, the fully Ui with Css modules and all the structure of the Dashboard following the tutorial of [Lama Dev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBg6xA5C60s&t=5669s) starting with this [Github](https://github.com/safak/nextadmin)

### .02 MongoDb Connection

Connected the MongoDb database and fetch the users.

- Mongoose for connect with MongoDB

```bash
npm i mongoose
```

### .03 Dashboard Backend

Use querry for filter by name and numb of items in a page.
Create user and products; add new, delete and update funtionality. Use Bcrypt for encrypt the password.

- Bcrypt for crypt the password

```bash
npm i bcrypt
```

Create authconfig for make the logic that will do the autenticate, in auth archive we put all the actions like signin or signout, and all the info that we should save in the cookies, and we created the middleware in the root folder.
Create a handleLogin logic that show the errors if user makes some error when he is trying to signin.
_-*This part is not working. When a user login it text Wrong credentials but it makes good the autorize. It gives a error abot NEXT_redirect and it doesnt goes automaticly to /dashboard but when u try to refresh or enter again in /login cant*._

- Next-auth for autenticate

```bash
npm i next-auth
```

### .04 Start of Blog

Started creating the basic structure for the blog. Established a connection to the articles in the database. Integrated Tailwind CSS into the project, transitioning from regular CSS to Tailwind. _Note that the main view of the dashboard is yet to be migrated to Tailwind._

### .05 Blog UI&Link

Hacer en la pantalla principal del blog que se puedan filtrar por categoria tambien.
Hacer toda la primera gran estructura del blog, pensar en los comentarios de los usuarios los mg...
Por lo menos la vista del articulo, que se vean los comentarios y dentro de estos hacer un hilo
que haya megusta, y opcion de repostear y mas que se a√±adiran en el futuro.

**HAY QUE HACER LAS COSAS MOBILE RESP.!!**

# **TAREAS**

- Hay que pasar el dashboard a mobile responsive
- Hay que arreglar lo de la autentificacion y la autorizacion al dashboard
